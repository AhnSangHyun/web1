  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/introduction.html#structure-of-this-specification" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">English</a><br><br><br>is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca.[5][6] <p>It is named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, as England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula in the Baltic Sea. The language is closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, and its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), and to <strong>a greater <U>extent by Latin</u> and French</strong></p>
